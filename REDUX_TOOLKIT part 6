we created fully functioning cake feature in last part
we create store in app folder in the structure
... app folder 
      ... store.js
in store.js

ADDING REDUX MIDDLEWARE:

lets take a middleware named reduxLogger
1. nom i redux-logger
2. const reduxLogger = require('redux-logger')
3. const logger = reduxLogger.createLogger();
logger will just return present past and future state after every update doen in store

in redux we created store using createStore from redux module but here we create store using configureStore 
1. const configureStore = require('@redux/toolkit').configureStore
2. import the reducer exported from features eg: cakeReducer we exported in part 5
   and import the reducer exported from iceCream feature eg: iceCreamReducer we exported in part 7
3. now invoke the configureStore function
  const store = configureStore({ // configure store accepts an object as an argument
      reducer: { // we have a key named reducer which acts as rootreducer where we combined all reducers in redux --> we can combine multiple reducers like this from diffrent features
        cake: cakeReducer, // cake is key name for cakeReducer
        icecream: iceCreamReducer, // as reducer is default export we imported as other name
      },
      middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware)=> getDefaultMiddleware().concat(logger) // key name middleware and for the list of default middleware retrived
                                                                                          from getDefaultMiddleware we add our logger middleware using concat
  })
our store is now complete
4. now export this store
module.exports = store

in index.js we can now import this store and use as similar to redux
like 
1. store.getState()
2. const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(listner) // this listner will run everytime the update occure in store --> listner is a function
to dispatch the actions we need to import the action creators from cake feature where we exported them at end from cakeSlice
3. we just use action creators like this
store.dispatch(cakeActions.ordered(2)) // cakeActions and iceCreamActions are exported as named so we use exact name when imported
store.dispatch(iceCreamActions.ordered(3))
and
store.dispatch(cakeActions.restocked(3))
store.dispatch(iceCreamActions.restocked(1))
