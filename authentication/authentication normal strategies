authentication in webdevelopment is recognizing user who is trying to access an account is the original owner of the account or not

if authenticated :
 we take username and password to verify the user 
 we check if the username and password is correct and matching on server
 if user is authenticated then how to let browser know that he is authenticated and 
 how does server know user is authenticated when request comes in
    weather user have to enter his credentials each and every time he sends request to server
                                    or
    we have some strategies to let server and browser know that user is authenticated 
        1. local storage
        2. cookie storage
        3. session storage
    for certain time period using these strategies will bypass the quthentication requests but in back end its actually authenticating user for every request sent
    without user involvement
1. local storage : for local storage authentication we can just store some part of user locally and authenticate whenever request is raised 
    but we can only store less information in it and it is not so secure way anyone who has access to local system can get their hands on it
2. cookie storage : here we are just storing the user data in encrypted form 
    Cookies are stored in the HTTP headers as key-value pairs it stored in client side or front end
    this strategy is also not so secure when cookies are found by user he can decode and get user details 
3. session storage : here the cookie is used but not to store the user details 
      used to store session id 
      session id is the reference id of session stored on database for temporary time period
      it is fast and secure way where user details are stored in session and session id is stored in cookie 
for every strategy we can set timer to get expired

JWT: 
  in these techniques above its unsecure without encoding/encrypting so to encrypt data we use the JWT jsonwebtoken
  in case of jwt we create a digital signature and store it in the repective technique 
  it takes three inputs and encrypt them 
      1. headers
      2. payload
      3. secret key
