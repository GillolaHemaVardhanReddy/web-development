whenever client sends request session is used for user authentication 
sessions are created on server with a session id and it stores user data
when a http req is sent from client to server 
a response can return with instructions to set a cookie with session id so that it can be stored on client
install express-session npm package

const session = require('express-session')
app.use(session({
  secret: 'some secret', // this secret is used to sign the cookie
  saveUninitialized: false, // to avoid saving unmodified session data to session store
  resave: false // it forces session to be saved back to session store even is the session was never modified during req
  cookie :{
    maxAge : 30000 // 30 sec after cookie expires 
  }
}))

when a sesion is created and the cookie is not expired then server wont generate new session or session id
