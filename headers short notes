http headers are some kind of indication for meta data of what res or req consists inside it
any header is actually a key value pair
there are 4 categories of headers :
1.Request header 
2.response header
3.payload header
4.respresentation header
this does not mean request header cant be in respose header or vise versa so 
both req and res headers may also be in payload headers
-------- REQUEST HEADERS -------------------
when ever request is recieved from client server understands its type and meaning from headers 
eg:
  host: www.abc.com
  user-agent: websiteSniffer/1.0
  referer: https://websniffer.com
  connection: close
  Accept-Language: en-US  // client understands only englisg
  Accept-Encoding : gzip // client can understand data compressed/encoded in gzip format only

user-agent and host represent whos sending the req
Accept-Language & accept-encoding tells what the client can understand

--------------RESPONSE HEADER ---------------
  whenever server sends data to client then it helps client understand using headers what type and meta data of response it sent
eg:
  connection: keep-alive
  server: server-name
  content-type: type of content it sent
  transfer-encoding: type of encoding it did
  last-modified: date of modification
  E-tag: version 
----------------REPRESENTATION HEADER ---------------------
  -> they talk about the data that has been transfered
the data sent may be of type xml,json,encoded in some format etc...
  eg:
    content-type: text/html
    content-encoding: gzip
    content-length: 3523
    content-range: bytes 50-1000
    content-location: /docs/fo.xml
