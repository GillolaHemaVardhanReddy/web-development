at best there are two methods to debug they are:
1. console.log()  --> use this to break and divide the code check whats happening at each and every step
2. add this word at the place where you what to know the variable values "debugger" and
  use --> node inspect nodeAppname.js or node --inspect-brk nodeAppname.js
  goto chrome and type chrome://inspect and go to devices 
     in remote target you see a port and localhost 
       this screen appears only when used debugger word in code and terminal changes to debug console and to shutdown the debug console click ctrl c twice
