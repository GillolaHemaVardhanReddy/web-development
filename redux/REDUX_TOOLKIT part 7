now lets say we have more features in the redux
features are just like states 
so 
1. const createSlice = require('@redux/toolkit').createSlice
2. create an initial state 
const initialState = {
  noOfIceCreams : 10
}
3. const iceCreamSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'icecream',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    ordered : (state,action)=>{
      state.noOfIceCreams-=action.payload;
    },
    restocked : (state,action)=>{
      state.noOfIceCreams+=action.payload;
    },
  }
})
4. export reducer as default reducer and actions as named exports
module.exports = iceCreamSlice.reducer
module.exports.iceCreamActions = iceCreamSlice.actions
