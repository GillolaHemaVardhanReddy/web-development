just follow all the steps done from part 5 till part 8 and redux-toolkit more docs in react project
changes are:
  1. in case of imports: we use import statements in case of require()
  2. in case of exports we use 
        export default NamedSlice.reducer
        export const {ordered,restocked} = cakeSlice.actions or anyNamedSlice.actions
  3. directly export function whuch uses createAsyncThunk 
  4. to avoid naming conventions in case of ordered and restocked use 
        import {ordered as cakeOrdered} from 'destination of cakeSlice.actions exported'
  5. to integrate both react and reduxtoolkit use react-redux
        npm i react-redux
        to provide our redux store to react application react-redux provides Provider component with props store
        import {Provider} from 'react-redux'
        <Provider store = {store}> // import the main store from redux app folder in redux folder
            <App/>
        </Provider>
   6. how to access state in store
    we use a special hook named useSelector() imported from 'react-redux'
      import {useSelector} from 'react-redux'
      const numOfCakes = useSelector((state)=>state.cake.numOfCakes)
          --> here useSelector takes arg mas a function
              this function is known as selector function
              and state refers to store and cake refers to reducer key name in store object or reducer
              at last noOfCakes refer to its state and access it from there
            so in selector function state is taken as arg and 
            this state is our store typically
            this store has various reducers in reducers key value pair of object taken by configureStore 
            every reducer in reducers object has a key value pair where key is used to refer the value and value is our specific reducer of a feature
            in this feature reducer we have the original state where we can directly access any state variable using .
  7. how to dispatch actions from react
      we have a special hook named useDispatch in recat-redux
          import {useDispatch} from 'react-redux'
      and also import actions required from specific feature created by createSlice
      store useDispatch in some other constant and use like this: cosnt dispatch = useDispatch()
      in any event listener like onClick use dispatch(action)
      <button onClick={()=>dispatch(ordered(2))}>order a cake</button>
  8. we can do same for fetchdata too
